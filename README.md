# wicked-scheduler

## Purpose

The purpose of this application was to utilize local storage and create a simple work day planner. The user will have the ability to enter TODOs into a time block of 9am-5pm. Once the user selects the save button, the inputed TODOs will remain on the local storage until removed by the user.
